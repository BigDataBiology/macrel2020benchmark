This repository includes code for benchmarking *FACS*.

This is a companion repository to:

> _FACS: FACS - Fast antimicrobial peptides screening in high throughput data_
> by Célio Dias Santos Júnior and Luis Pedro Coelho _in_ Bionformatics XX:YY (2019)
> [http://doi.org/XXX](http://doi.org/XXX)

It contains most of rules to rebuild the benchmark proposed in the paper.

However, it is needed to read some steps, since they were curated manually.
